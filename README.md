# Reddit Client

This is a Reddit client Android app developed as a learning project for native Android development.
While it's not yet complete, it provides basic functionality to interact with Reddit.

Because it's a learning project, it doesn't follow patterns as they should, and doesn't implement
any testing so I don't recommend this repo to anyone that wants to start learning android.

## Features

- **Login and Authentication:** Users can log in using their Reddit credentials.
- **Browse Home Feed:** View popular posts.
- **Read Posts:** Read posts from selected subreddits.
- **Browse Saved Posts**
- **Scroll to next comment button**
- **Zooming on images similar to instagram**
